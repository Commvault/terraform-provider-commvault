# Terraform Provider for Commvault

With the Commvault Terraform module, you can use Terraform to manage endpoints (called resources). Terraform is a configuration language for safely and efficiently managing infrastructure.

The Commvault Terraform module provides a set of named resource types, and specifies which arguments are allowed for each resource type. Using the resource types, you can create a configuration file, and apply changes to the Commvault REST APIs.
